Description : this is the SQL file which contains all data of the Madagascar's fokontany.

# base-fokontany

Many developpers asks on the internet (forum, social network, etc.) to have the base of the Madagascar's fokontany.
So, the the base is now available (all fokontany on Madagascar).

You can use it for your personnal project or profesionnal project.

We have two type of the base on which :
- the first is that ID of the table is auto increment
- the seconde is that the ID have the same size. (the advantage of this one is the security of data when you will send the ID through XHR (ajax), or via GET method directly in the link).

Thank you
